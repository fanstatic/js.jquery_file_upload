js.jquery_file_upload
=====================

Introduction
------------

This library packages `jQuery File Upload Plugin`_ for `fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`jQuery File Upload Plugin`: http://blueimp.github.com/jQuery-File-Upload/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.jquery_file_upload``) are published to some URL.
