How to use?
===========

You can import ``fileupload`` from ``js.jquery_file_upload`` and ``need`` it
where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.jquery_file_upload import fileupload
  >>> fileupload.need()

For CORS::

  >>> from js.jquery_file_upload import postmessage_transport
  >>> postmessage_transport.need()

and / or::

  >>> from js.jquery_file_upload import xdr_transport
  >>> xdr_transport.need()

All of the above include only Javascript resources.  To also include the CSS
resources you can::

  >>> from js.jquery_file_upload import ui_noscript
  >>> ui_noscript.need()

and / or::

  >>> from js.jquery_file_upload import ui
  >>> ui.need()
